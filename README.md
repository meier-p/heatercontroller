**Heating Controller for Boats and Mobile Applications**
========================================================

A modular and customizable controller designed to manage heating systems on **boats, caravans, mobile homes**, or any application where a single air heating unit distributes heat to multiple zones. The system supports independent **monitoring and regulation** of temperature across zones, integration with **OpenPlotter/Signal K**, **Node-RED** (using Signal K or MQTT), and all **NMEA 2000 marine chart plotters** (currently via Signal K) for monitoring and operation. It offers expandability for future enhancements, including remote control and monitoring over the internet.
